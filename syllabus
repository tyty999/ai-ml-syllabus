Autonomous Navigation & Manipulation: Applying agentic frameworks and DRL for complex robotic tasks.

Generative AI for Robot Design: Using generative models to design robot components or behaviors.

Capstone Project / Applied AI Practicum:

Core: A culminating project demonstrating mastery across disciplines.

AI Integration: Projects will inherently involve significant AI components, likely incorporating LLMs, generative AI, agentic frameworks, MCP, and A2A communication to solve complex, real-world problems. Emphasis on end-to-end system design, deployment, and ethical considerations.

This outline truly positions AI, LLMs, Generative AI, and agentic paradigms as central to the entire technology curriculum, reflecting their pervasive role in 2025 and beyond.
